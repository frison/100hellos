# Smalltalk

Quoting [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smalltalk):

> Smalltalk is a purely object oriented programming language (OOP), which was originally created in the 1970s for educational use, specifically for constructionist learning, but later found use in business. It was created at Xerox PARC by Learning Research Group (LRG) scientists, including Alan Kay, Dan Ingalls, Adele Goldberg, Ted Kaehler, Diana Merry, and Scott Wallace.

> In Smalltalk, executing programs are built of opaque, atomic, so-called objects, which are instances of template code stored in classes. These objects intercommunicate by passing of messages, via an intermediary virtual machine environment (VM). A relatively small number of objects, called primitives, are not amenable to live redefinition, sometimes being defined independently of the Smalltalk programming environment. 

Smalltalk is notable for influencing a wide range of languages, including Ruby and Crystal, which both copy a lot of Smalltalk's syntax and idioms.

In this container we make use of the GNU Smalltalk implementation of Smalltalk-80 to demonstrate a simple program which defines a class, instantiates it, and sends it a message.
